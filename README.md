Arduino-STM32-CAN
-----------------

This has been forked from https://github.com/nopnop2002/Arduino-STM32-CAN and is being converted into a C++
class-based library.

I at first considered using the HAL from STM32duino, but I got buried in the details and wanted something
a bit simpler.   My target is the STM32F042xx series, so I am going for making this as simple and compact
as I can.
